## Disclaimer

I am just "some guy", not a doctor or nutritionist.  

I did a lot of research on this subject and used it myself for about a year with great results before falling off the wagon.

I also co-founded a company (which I'm no longer associated with) employing some of the principles of the ketogenic dient, 
[Restore Health](http://www.restorehealth.com), which had fantastic results.

## Definitions

### Keto

The human body can run happily on two different fuel sources:  fat or sugar.  
When you give it both at the same time, your body burns the sugar and stores the fat.
A ketogenic diet is "fat heavy" and very low sugar.  

### Keto adapted

If you've been eating a standard American diet for a long time, 
it actually takes a while for your body to adjust to the new diet and re-learn how to run on fat.
This is referred to as "keto adapted".  For me, this process took several weeks.  

### Keto flu

I actually went through sugar withdrawl and had a few days where I felt like I had the flu.
This is referred to as "keto flu".
The day it passed, I felt fantastic.  Full of energy, alert, and just in a much better mood.

## Tips

### Read the nutrition labels on everything

You should figure out "net carbs", which subtracts out the fiber because it doesn't turn into sugar.
"Total carbs" minus "fiber" is a good approximation.  
Google it if you want a more accurate calculation or details.

### Ketone test strips

[Ketone test strips](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ketostix)
can be a great way to "dial in" when you're first getting into ketosis to see if you're doing it right.

  1.  Darker is not better.  It's likea pregnancy test.  You're either in or out.  There is no degree.

  2.  As your body becomes keto adapted, you will burn more ketones and eliminate less.  After your body adapts, 
  you could be in keto and still not change the color of a strip.

### Drink lots of water

IIRC, ketone metabolism uses more water than sugar metabolism.  

### Supplements / electrolytes

All the water you drink flushes out electrolytes.  If you get low on these, you can end up feeling groggy and crappy.

I used two supplements:

  1.  [Lite Salt](https://www.amazon.com/Morton-Lite-Salt-Sodium-Table/dp/B0005YM0UY) - includes potassium as well as sodium.  
  Use it liberally.
  
  2.  [Cal Mag](https://www.amazon.com/Amway-Nutrilite-Cal-Mag-tablets/dp/B01N1G6FG9) - includes calcium and magnesium.
  
I honestly no longer recall the process I used to settle on these,
but was feeling a bit wiped out about 3 months into the diet and these fixed it.    

### A Crock Pot Is Your Friend

Personally, I found using a crock pot to make a batch of "low carb" or "keto friendly" food was a great was to stay on track.
Easy to make a batch of food, and having it handy kept me from looking for other things to eat.

I just used "low carb crok pot" recipe books, but 
[this one](https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Crock-Made-Easy-Budget-Friendly-ebook/dp/B0768HGSBT)
looks very interesting.

### Choice Architecture

Make it as hard as possible to eat non-keto foods.  If you can, throw away the junk food, soda, etc.  
If you can't, put it in the closet, on the top shelf, back of the fridge.  
Always make sure the good stuff is closer at hand than the things you're trying to avoid.

### Cheat Intelligently

You're going to go "off plan" occasionally.  This is normal and helps keep you sane.  Just don't do it "too often".

If you are going to consume sugar (or foods your body turns into sugar), the worst thing you can do it eat them with fat.  
If I was having something naughty, I would try to do it at least 2 hours before or after a regular meal, 
to give my body time to process the fat and sugar separately.

### Fat Bombs

Google "fat bombs" and you'll find lots of recipes for high-fat items that will help you keep your diet 
tipped towards fat and away from carbs.

### Too Much Protein

There are 3 macros:  fat, carbs, and protein.  You need to lean towards fat.  
Your body can actually turn a percentage of protein into sugar through a process called
[gluconeogenesis](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Principles_of_Biochemistry/Gluconeogenesis_and_Glycogenesis)

So, if all you eat is  jerky and steaks, you won't actually get int ketosis.  It's a "fat heavy" diet, not a "meat heavy" diet.

### Almond Flour

If you find yourself craving baked good, almond flour is a good substitute.  
I used to make almond flour muffins to grab on the way out the door in the morning.
